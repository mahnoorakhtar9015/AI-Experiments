# 🧪 AI/ML/GenAI Experiments

## 💡 Mission
Documenting my learning journey in AI, ML, and GenAI from fundamentals to advanced experiments.

## 🗂️ Structure

- **supervised_learning/**: Regression & classification tasks
- **unsupervised_learning/**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction
- **deep_learning/**: CNNs, LSTMs, advanced neural architectures
- **nlp/**: Natural Language Processing tasks
- **computer_vision/**: Image, video, and vision applications
- **generative_ai/**: Text & image generation, diffusion, GANs
- **reinforcement_learning/**: Policy learning, Q-learning, advanced RL
- **time_series/**: Forecasting, signal analysis


## 🧰 How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Open any notebook and run

## 📈 Progress
I’ll be adding at least one experiment daily.  
Check back often or ⭐️ star the repo to follow.
